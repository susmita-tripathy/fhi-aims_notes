1) Organisation of the tutorial/notes: (New pages for each section)
  -0. Installing FHIaims (Why? I already have it)
  -1. Doing structure optimization (molecule, bulk, surface) (Why? Required for good core-hole spectra)
     -a) Basic files
     -b) Any caveats or tips
     -c) Takeaways
2) Core-hole calculations in aims (molecule, bulk, surface)
   -a) Basics (Little bit theory, choice of functional, choice of basis, choice of method)
   -b) XPS (full core-hole delta-scf, GW) - 1abc
   -c) NEXAFS (half core-hole) -1abc -holeconstraint, dipole matrix
   -d) Other methods: (to be updated later)

3) Changes in FHIaims (to be considered in notes) Newer additions via 2023version:
   -a) defaults_2020 (gw basis)
   -b) change in delta_basis vs force_occupation keywords (if no change, just mention)
