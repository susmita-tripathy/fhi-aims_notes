### FHI-aims notes:

The following notes were collected as a learning exercise for me. The notes consists of bare bone basics and scripts for running calculations in FHI-aims, mostly calculations relevant to core-hole spectra. 
The following incorporates the steps required to obtain input files and results from 2021 FHI-aims tutorials. The lecture videos and slides used during the tutorials are given here: [https://indico.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/event/112/](https://indico.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/event/112/).
